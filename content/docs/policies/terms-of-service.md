### Terms of Service

**Effective March 29, 2024**

Welcome to Prosphora. It's important for you to understand our terms, policies, and rules before using our services.

#### Accepting these Terms

These Terms of Service (“Terms”), along with our rules, policies, and referenced documents, form a legally binding contract between you and Prosphora, Inc. (“Prosphora”). This contract outlines your rights and responsibilities when you use Prosphora’s website and services (collectively, the “Service”). To access most features, you’ll need to register for an account (“Account”). Please read these Terms carefully.

**BY USING OUR SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS, FORMING A BINDING CONTRACT.**

The Help Center, accessible from our website, includes our Prohibited Conduct, Prohibited Items policies, and frequently asked questions (“FAQ”).

We may update these Terms at any time on our website. Changes are effective upon posting. If changes reduce your rights or increase your responsibilities, we'll notify you.

#### Service Description

Prosphora operates as an online platform facilitating donations for nonprofit organizations. Our service is designed to support nonprofit fundraising, donor engagement, and transaction facilitation, distinct from traditional consumer-to-consumer marketplaces.

Prosphora does not engage in buying or selling goods directly, nor do we take possession of donated items. Our platform simply facilitates the donation process, with donors (“Donors”) and recipient nonprofits (“Recipients”) responsible for their own transactions. Both Donors and Recipients are collectively referred to as “Users” of the Service.

Our payment processing services for donations utilize third-party providers. We support various payment options, including credit/debit cards and electronic payment methods. Prosphora oversees refunds and payment disputes but does not involve itself in disputes between Users beyond transactional issues.

By using our service and accepting these Terms, you also agree to our Privacy Policy.

#### Other Policies

Our service is available in the United States. Users must reside in the U.S., and individuals must be at least 18 years old or the age of majority in their state of residence.

#### Your Account with Prosphora

To use most features of our Service, you'll need to create an Account. We reserve the right to take action, including account termination, if your use violates our Terms or is deemed inappropriate or illegal.

Some key points about Accounts:

- Use of an Account for illegal purposes or in violation of any law or these Terms is strictly prohibited.
- Each User may only maintain one Account, and payment instruments or bank accounts cannot be shared across multiple Accounts.
- Accurate and current User Information is required, and we may verify this information with third-party vendors.
- You are responsible for keeping your Account secure and for all activity on your Account.

#### Termination of Account

You can terminate your Account at any time via Account Settings. Some information may be retained in our records post-termination.

#### License and Restrictions

We grant you a personal, limited, non-transferable license to use our Website. You may not modify, distribute, or create derivative works from our Service.

#### Third-Party Services

Our Service may link to third-party websites or services. You access these at your own risk, and such third parties may have their own terms and privacy policies.

#### Your Content

You're responsible for any content you post using our Service, ensuring you have the right to use it. By posting, you grant Prosphora a license to use your content to support the Service and community.

#### Use of Our Service

You agree not to use our Service to break the law or harm our systems. You also agree to our Electronic Communications Policy and acknowledge that we provide information electronically rather than in paper form.

#### Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability

Our Service is provided "as is" without any warranty. We disclaim all warranties, to the extent permitted by law, and our liability to you is limited to the greater of $100 or the amount you've paid us in the past 12 months.

#### Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed and construed under the laws of the State of Washington, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any dispute arising from or related to these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Washington State.
